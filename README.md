#Number to Words

This program contains the title_case method, and a Sinatra app that will deploy the program and allow the user to interact.

The title_case method will take a string input from the user and output that string as title case.

Title case is defined as: The first word capitalized, all other words except a list of common exceptions are also capitalized.

This program also ensures that the case of all characters is correct by calling the downcase method before capitalizing the select words.

>Example: Input = ThE DoG Is blue Output = The Dog is Blue

**Requirements:**
- Ruby 2.2.0
- Rubygems, Bundler
- Sinatra
- Capybara - for testing
